<h3> Bull and Cows Rule: </h3>

• 	
On a sheet of paper, each player writes a 4-digit secret number, with no repeated digits, which they must not let their opponent see.

• 	
The players take turns trying to guess each other's secret number. After each guess, their opponent provides feedback about the number of matches: if they guess a correct digit in the correct position, it is called a "bull," while if they match a digit but in the wrong position, it is called a "cow."

For example, if your opponent's secret number is "1854" and you guess "4879," the feedback you will receive is: 1 bull and 1 cow ("8" is the bull, and "4" is the cow).

• 	
The first person to reveal their opponent's secret number wins the game.
